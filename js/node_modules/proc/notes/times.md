So if you send this stats object to circonus, you can take these values:

obj.utime = 
obj.stime = 
obj.ttime = 
obj.tftime =
obj.dftime =
obj.kftime =
obj.ltime = 
obj.slptime 
obj.wtime = 
obj.stoptime

And then turn them into counters, then stack them.
And they should add up to 1.
At which point victory will be achieved.
But you have to use my version with fractional times, or else it'll never add up.

For most of these types like mrcv or whatever, you'll want to convert them to "counter" types in circonus and call the graph "messages per second"
